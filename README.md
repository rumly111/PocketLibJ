## About ##
Pocket Library is an Android interface to an e-library containing a collection of books (~5000).

## Features ##
* Viewing lists of all books, authors and genres
* Searching books by title or author
* Adding books to favourites
* Using a simple internal or external viewer to read books
* Saving reading position
* Customizable font size

## Warning ##
The books itself are not free, they are not included. You can download the archive here: http://www.ex.ua/725594615744 .
You can also set up a web server to access the book library via http, so there is no need to store the whole
archive on your phone (~1Gb).

## Building ##
Clone the repository, then import it into your Eclipse workspace (the ADT plugin must be installed).
